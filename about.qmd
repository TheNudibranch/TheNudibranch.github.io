Hello! My name is Ian, I am the Technical Lead Data Scientist working in the Customer Insights group at [Wegmans](https://www.wegmans.com/). My main interests lie in analyzing consumer behavior using Bayesian statistics and classical machine learning techniques. When my sampler is running you can find me outside looking at mushrooms or inside reading if it's too rainy.
